# Neural Networks and Learning Systems

This repository showcases lab assignments completed in a **Neural Networks and Learning Systems** course. It provides examples of building machine learning algorithms from the scratch and implementing various neural network architectures to solve different problems.


**Welcome!** This repository contains my lab assignments from the **Neural Networks and Learning Systems** course.

**What will you find here?**

* **Four lab folders:** Each folder represents a different lab assignment with its corresponding:
    * **Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb):** This interactive notebook contains the code for building and training neural networks, performing data analysis, and visualizing the results.
    * **Converted HTML Report (.html):** This static report, originally a Jupyter Notebook, provides a clear and concise explanation of the lab's objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.


**Disclaimer:** This repository serves as a personal learning portfolio and does not claim to provide complete solutions or code for specific assignments. It is intended to showcase learning progress and applied skills in building and utilizing machine learning algorithms and neural networks.
